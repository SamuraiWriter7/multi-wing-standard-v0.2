# Kazene Operational Semantics

## Overview

This document defines the **operational semantics** of **Kazene** within the **Multi-Wing Standard Specification**.

In earlier documents, Kazene is introduced as the coordination principle of dynamic balance, local interaction, structured emergence, and trace-aware cooperation across Wings.  
This document extends that concept by defining how Kazene behaves as an **operational system** rather than only as a conceptual principle.

The purpose of this document is to make Kazene:

- interpretable
- implementable
- testable
- measurable
- compatible with conformance-oriented architecture

Kazene is therefore treated here not as metaphor, but as a **coordination semantics for distributed intelligence**.

---

## Purpose

Kazene Operational Semantics defines the conditions under which a Multi-Wing system may be said to exhibit:

- local coordination
- balanced task distribution
- adaptive reconfiguration
- bounded failure propagation
- review-aware progression
- trace-preserving revision
- explicit escalation
- visible degraded operation

Without such semantics, Kazene risks remaining a descriptive ideal rather than an implementable coordination discipline.

---

## Scope

This document defines:

- coordination states
- coordination transitions
- rebalance conditions
- escalation triggers
- failure containment expectations
- degraded-mode expectations
- trace-preservation expectations during coordination
- observable indicators of Kazene-like behavior

This document does **not** define:

- a transport protocol
- a scheduler implementation
- numerical optimization algorithms
- a mandatory distributed runtime
- a fixed economic settlement model

Kazene Operational Semantics is a **coordination law layer**, not a runtime engine.

---

## Core Operational Assumption

Kazene assumes that coherent system-level intelligence may arise when:

1. Wings are role-differentiated
2. interactions are structured
3. context continuity is preserved
4. failure does not automatically globalize
5. review can alter the path of execution
6. trace continuity is not silently destroyed
7. reconfiguration remains bounded and inspectable
8. authority can escalate when a local path reaches its limit

In operational terms:

> **Kazene is the semantics of how a distributed intelligence field stays coherent while remaining non-monolithic.**

---

## Coordination Unit

The minimal coordination unit in Kazene is a **task-bound interaction segment** involving:

- one or more Wings
- one task context
- one or more state transitions
- optional review or revision events
- optional trace-preserving transformations
- optional rebalance or escalation events

A Multi-Wing system does not need to be globally synchronized at all times.  
Kazene applies locally first, and system-level coherence emerges through coordinated local segments.

---

## Coordination States

Kazene coordination is expressed through a set of observable states.

The recommended state set for v0.2-aligned implementations is:

- `idle`
- `discovered`
- `advertised`
- `proposed`
- `assigned`
- `executing`
- `in-review`
- `revision-requested`
- `rebalanced`
- `finalized`
- `escalated`
- `failed`
- `degraded`

These states MAY be extended by implementations, but the semantic meaning of the core states SHOULD remain compatible.

---

## State Semantics

### `idle`
No active coordination is occurring for the relevant task segment.

### `discovered`
A relevant Wing or coordination path has been identified for potential participation.

### `advertised`
Capabilities, constraints, or profile compatibility have been declared for coordination.

### `proposed`
A candidate artifact, plan, or next action has been introduced into the coordination field.

### `assigned`
Responsibility for the next action has been explicitly or effectively delegated.

### `executing`
A Wing is actively performing a task-bound operation.

### `in-review`
An artifact, proposal, or decision is being evaluated by one or more reviewing Wings or review-equivalent mechanisms.

### `revision-requested`
A prior output has been deemed insufficient, incomplete, risky, or inconsistent, and a revision path has been initiated.

### `rebalanced`
The coordination path has been altered to restore functional balance, reduce overload, isolate risk, or improve fit between task and role.

### `finalized`
The current coordination segment has produced an artifact or decision considered sufficient for the intended boundary of completion.

### `escalated`
The current coordination path could not safely or sufficiently resolve the task, and responsibility has been transferred to a higher, external, or more authoritative path.

### `failed`
The current coordination path has failed to progress within defined constraints.

### `degraded`
The system is still operating, but under constrained conditions such as reduced capability, missing Wings, partial context loss, lower review depth, or limited trace fidelity.

## Transition Semantics

Kazene requires that state changes be meaningful rather than decorative.

The following transitions are considered semantically valid in the recommended model:

- `idle -> discovered`
- `discovered -> advertised`
- `advertised -> proposed`
- `proposed -> assigned`
- `assigned -> executing`
- `executing -> in-review`
- `in-review -> revision-requested`
- `revision-requested -> assigned`
- `executing -> finalized`
- `in-review -> finalized`
- `executing -> rebalanced`
- `in-review -> rebalanced`
- `assigned -> escalated`
- `executing -> escalated`
- `in-review -> escalated`
- `executing -> failed`
- `failed -> rebalanced`
- `failed -> escalated`
- `executing -> degraded`
- `degraded -> rebalanced`
- `degraded -> finalized`
- `degraded -> escalated`

Implementations MAY support additional transitions, but SHOULD document them explicitly.

---

## Local Interaction Semantics

Kazene is fundamentally local-first.

This means:

- a Wing SHOULD act primarily on the task scope and context scope relevant to its declared role
- no Wing SHOULD assume global authority merely by being present in the coordination graph
- global system effects SHOULD arise through coordination chaining, not hidden universal access

A local interaction is considered valid when:

1. the acting Wing has role relevance to the task
2. the Wing has sufficient access rights to the relevant context
3. the produced change remains attributable
4. the interaction does not silently bypass required review or escalation conditions

If these conditions are violated, the coordination path risks pseudo-distribution rather than Kazene-like behavior.

---

## Balance Semantics

Kazene defines balance as an operational property, not as equal participation.

A coordination path is considered **balanced** when:

- no single Wing performs all critical functions without declared justification
- routing remains inspectable
- review is possible where task risk warrants it
- context access is not silently monopolized
- authority concentration is explicit rather than accidental

A coordination path is considered **imbalanced** when:

- one Wing implicitly performs generation, validation, routing, and final authority without declared design intent
- review paths are structurally present but never reachable
- escalation exists only nominally
- context mutation is dominated by one unreviewed path
- trace continuity depends on one opaque internal process

Imbalance is not always forbidden, but it MUST be visible if it exists.

---

## Rebalance Semantics

Rebalancing is one of the defining operational features of Kazene.

A system enters `rebalanced` when coordination is deliberately altered in order to restore viability, clarity, or safety.

Rebalancing MAY include:

- reassigning a task to a more suitable Wing
- inserting a Verification Wing into a previously unchecked path
- splitting a composite path into more explicit roles
- narrowing context scope
- increasing review depth
- redirecting to a lower-latency or safer execution path
- reducing dependency on a failed or overloaded Wing

A rebalance is considered **valid** when:

1. the prior coordination path had a detectable limitation or risk
2. the new path is more appropriate under current conditions
3. the reason for rebalance is inspectable
4. trace continuity is preserved where relevant

---

## Escalation Semantics

Escalation is mandatory in Kazene when the current coordination path cannot safely continue under existing assumptions.

Typical escalation triggers include:

- unresolved contradiction
- policy conflict
- insufficient evidence
- role ambiguity
- trace inconsistency
- review deadlock
- repeated failed revision
- explicit human-oversight requirement
- authority boundary reached

A Kazene-aligned implementation MUST define at least one escalation condition and one escalation target class.

Escalation MUST NOT be modeled as silent abandonment.

An escalation event SHOULD preserve:

- prior state
- responsible Wing(s)
- triggering reason
- relevant artifact references
- relevant trace references

---

## Failure Containment Semantics

Failure containment is central to Kazene.

A failure is considered **contained** when:

- the failing Wing or segment can be isolated
- the failure does not automatically invalidate unrelated Wings
- the system can either rebalance or escalate without full collapse
- trace and context remain sufficiently recoverable for continuation or audit

A failure is considered **uncontained** when:

- one local failure destroys all task continuity
- context becomes globally unusable
- responsibility becomes non-attributable
- review state is lost without recovery path
- routing depends entirely on the failed component

A Kazene-oriented system SHOULD be designed so that local failure produces either:

- bounded degradation
- rebalance
- escalation

rather than total systemic opacity.

---

## Degradation Semantics

Degradation is not identical to failure.

A system is degraded when it continues to function under reduced quality, speed, confidence, review depth, trace depth, or context fidelity.

Examples include:

- a Verification Wing is unavailable, so outputs remain provisional
- a Memory Wing has limited context freshness
- an edge-constrained path can produce summaries but not full synthesis
- trace-signing is temporarily unavailable while trace references remain preserved
- only a reduced profile of review can be applied within latency constraints

A degraded state is acceptable if:

- the limitation is visible
- the altered confidence or authority boundary is visible
- the system does not falsely present degraded output as fully validated

Kazene permits degraded operation, but not deceptive degradation.

---

## Review Semantics

Review is a structural operation in Kazene, not a cosmetic add-on.

A review event is valid when:

1. it is performed by a role-appropriate Wing or mechanism
2. it evaluates a specific artifact, proposal, or decision
3. it can produce a meaningful outcome
4. its result can affect subsequent coordination

Valid review outcomes include:

- acceptance
- rejection
- conditional acceptance
- revision request
- escalation request

A review that cannot alter the coordination path is not fully operational review in Kazene terms.

---

## Revision Semantics

Revision occurs when an artifact is modified in response to review, conflict, rebalancing, or updated context.

A valid revision SHOULD preserve:

- the revised artifact reference
- the prior artifact reference
- the revising Wing identity
- the triggering condition or review result
- relevant trace continuity

Revision is central because Kazene treats intelligence as a field of structured correction rather than one-shot emission.

---

## Trace Preservation Semantics

Trace-aware coordination is one of the strongest differentiators of Kazene.

At a minimum, trace preservation means that when an artifact is:

- introduced
- proposed
- assigned
- executed
- reviewed
- revised
- rebalanced
- finalized
- escalated

the system SHOULD preserve enough structure to answer:

- what prior source or contribution informed this artifact
- what changed
- who changed it
- why the change occurred
- whether prior references were retained, replaced, or superseded
- what authority path moved the artifact forward

Trace preservation need not always mean cryptographic signing.  
But silent severance of origin chains is semantically hostile to Kazene.

---

## Centralization Threshold Semantics

Kazene does not ban coordination centers, but it resists hidden centralization.

A system SHOULD define indicators that help detect when coordination has become effectively monolithic.

Examples of useful indicators include:

- one Wing handling an excessive proportion of task stages
- one Wing dominating finalization authority across unrelated tasks
- absence of reachable review alternatives
- context write access concentrated in one unreviewed path
- repeated rebalance failure caused by dependency on one Wing

If such conditions persist without explicit design acknowledgment, the system may no longer be operationally Kazene-like.

---

## Observable Indicators

To make Kazene measurable, implementations SHOULD expose or make derivable indicators such as:

- task-stage distribution by Wing
- review insertion rate
- revision frequency
- escalation frequency
- rebalance frequency
- trace-retention rate
- failed-path recovery rate
- degraded-mode frequency
- coordination bottleneck concentration
- time-to-finalization under review-aware flow

These indicators are not all mandatory in v0.2, but they are strongly recommended for reference implementations and stronger conformance suites.

---

## Minimal Operational Conformance

A minimally Kazene-aligned implementation SHOULD be able to demonstrate:

1. explicit coordination states or state-equivalent lifecycle stages
2. observable state transitions
3. at least one rebalance or escalation path
4. role-differentiated participation
5. review-capable lifecycle progression
6. bounded failure behavior or degraded-mode handling
7. trace-preserving behavior where trace-aware claims are made

If a system cannot demonstrate these, Kazene may be present as language but not as operational semantics.

---

## Recommended Metrics for Reference Implementations

Reference implementations SHOULD measure at least some of the following:

### Coordination Stability
How often the system reaches useful completion without looping indefinitely or collapsing into unresolved routing churn.

### Review Gain
How much review improves artifact quality, consistency, or reliability.

### Trace Retention
How often trace continuity survives from proposal through finalization.

### Failure Containment
How often local failure remains local rather than globalizing.

### Role Purity
How consistently Wings remain within their declared role boundaries.

### Rebalance Effectiveness
How often rebalancing improves progression, safety, or clarity.

### Degradation Honesty
How often degraded operation is surfaced explicitly rather than silently masking reduced guarantees.

These metrics are not yet a full conformance suite, but they form a practical foundation for operational evaluation.

## What Kazene Operational Semantics Is Not

This document does not imply that:

- every system must be egalitarian
- all tasks require review
- all outputs require cryptographic trace
- all systems must rebalance dynamically at runtime
- hierarchy is forbidden
- orchestration is forbidden

Kazene permits structure, hierarchy, routing, and authority.  
What it rejects is **opaque concentration without explicit semantics**.

---

## Operational Definition

The operational definition of Kazene may be stated as follows:

> **Kazene is the coordination semantics by which a distributed intelligence system maintains coherence through explicit roles, local interaction, bounded failure propagation, review-aware progression, adaptive rebalancing, explicit escalation, visible degraded operation, and trace-preserving transformation.**

---

## Relationship to Other Documents

This document should be read together with:

- `docs/kazene-coordination-principles.md`
- `docs/wing-composition-rules.md`
- `docs/trace-lifecycle-model.md`
- `spec/multi-wing-standard-specification-v0.2.md`

Roughly speaking:

- `kazene-coordination-principles.md` defines the conceptual coordination discipline
- this document defines the operational law
- `wing-composition-rules.md` defines safe and risky structural combinations
- `trace-lifecycle-model.md` defines continuity across coordination time

---

## Final Note

Kazene becomes real only when it can survive contact with failure, revision, and uncertainty.

That is why operational semantics matter.

Without them, Kazene is a philosophy of coordination.  
With them, Kazene becomes a testable law of distributed intelligence.
